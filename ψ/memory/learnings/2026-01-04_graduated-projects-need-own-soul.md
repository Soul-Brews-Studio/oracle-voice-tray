# Learning: Graduated Projects Need Their Own Soul

> Discovered: 2026-01-04 | Context: voice-tray-v2 spinoff from Nat-s-Agents

## Pattern

When a project graduates (spins off) from the main incubation repo, it needs its own minimal soul structure.

## Setup Steps

1. `/soul-lite` - Create minimal ψ/ (HOME, WIP, memory/)
2. `/oracle-init` - Install philosophy + writing style
3. `/awaken` - Install commands, agents, skills
4. Reference parent Oracle thread for history

## Structure

```
[graduated-repo]/
├── ψ/
│   ├── HOME.md
│   ├── WIP.md
│   └── memory/
│       ├── retrospectives/
│       └── learnings/
├── .claude/
│   ├── knowledge/
│   ├── commands/
│   ├── agents/
│   └── skills/
└── CLAUDE.md
```

## Knowledge Flow

- **Retrospectives**: Stay local in graduated repo
- **Learnings**: Can flow back to parent repo
- **Context**: Reference parent Oracle thread (thread 13 for voice-tray-v2)

## Why

Graduated projects are independent but connected. They need their own memory while maintaining links to origin story.

## Concepts

`incubation`, `spinoff`, `project-soul`, `graduation`
