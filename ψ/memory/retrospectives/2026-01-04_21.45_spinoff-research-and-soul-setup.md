# Retrospective: Spinoff Research & Soul Setup

> 2026-01-04 21:45 | voice-tray-v2 | ~45 min session

## What Happened

New Claude session on freshly spun-off voice-tray-v2 repo. Nat wanted deep research on project history and proper Oracle/Soul infrastructure setup.

### Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 21:03 | Session start - `pwd`, Ralph loop attempts (cancelled) |
| 21:08 | Oracle thread 13 investigation - DB hunting |
| 21:18 | **10 parallel agents launched** for comprehensive research |
| 21:25 | `/oracle-init` - philosophy + writing style |
| 21:28 | `/soul-lite` - minimal ψ/ structure |
| 21:30 | `/awaken` - commands, agents, skills installed |
| 21:35 | `/recap` + `/now` |
| 21:45 | This retrospective |

## The Research Swarm

Launched 10 agents in parallel to gather voice-tray-v2 history:

| Agent | Focus | Key Finding |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | claude-mem origins | Voice-tray initial creation |
| 2 | claude-mem spinoff | Why/when graduated |
| 3 | claude-mem bugs | Duplicate tray icon, white square |
| 4 | claude-mem features | DMG, icons, build process |
| 5 | Oracle searches | Thread listings |
| 6 | **Oracle DB direct** | Thread 13 = 8 messages, full context |
| 7 | **Nat-s-Agents incubate** | Lifecycle: 🌱→🌕→🎓→🤝 |
| 8 | MQTT/voice architecture | rumqttc, Axum, Tauri |
| 9 | Recent context | Jan 2-4 work timeline |
| 10 | **Codebase analysis** | Complete architecture docs |

**Pattern**: Parallel research >> sequential. 10 agents covered more ground in ~5 min than serial would in 30 min.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Oracle DB Location
```
/Users/nat/Code/github.com/laris-co/Nat-s-Agents/ψ/lab/oracle-v2/oracle.db
```
Not in project root. Not in ~/.config. Lives in the main Nat-s-Agents soul.

### 2. Thread 13 Contents
Full project context dump including:
- Architecture flow diagram
- Tech stack table
- Features list
- Timeline (Jan 2-4)
- Related repos
- Documentation locations
- GitHub Issue #92

### 3. Incubation Lifecycle
```
🌱 Seed → 🌕 Grow → 🎓 Graduate → 🤝 Reunion
```
Voice-tray-v2 is at **🎓 Graduate** - own repo, knowledge stays in Nat-s-Agents.

### 4. Spinoff Pattern
```bash
# When project > 1GB (especially Rust target/)
gh repo create laris-co/[name] --private
rsync (exclude target/)
# Result: 1.7GB → 11MB
```

## What Got Built

### Files Created
```
RESEARCH-NOTES.md          # Consolidated research (architecture, timeline, where to get more info)
CLAUDE.md                  # Project instructions + Oracle reference
.claude/knowledge/
├── oracle-philosophy.md   # Core principles
└── writing-style.md       # Voice guide
ψ/
├── HOME.md               # Soul navigation
├── WIP.md                # Current work
└── memory/
    ├── retrospectives/   # This file lives here
    └── learnings/
.claude/commands/         # 11 commands (trace, rrr, etc.)
.claude/agents/           # 3 agents
.claude/skills/           # 2 skills
```

### Infrastructure State
- Oracle philosophy: ✅ Installed
- Soul structure: ✅ Minimal (soul-lite)
- Commands/agents: ✅ Awakened
- Git: ⚠️ Untracked files need commit

## Learnings

### 1. Parallel Agent Research Pattern
When exploring unknown territory, spawn N agents with different search vectors. Combine results. Much faster than serial exploration.

**When to use**: New repo onboarding, deep context gathering, history reconstruction.

### 2. Oracle Thread as Project Context
Thread 13 serves as the "canonical context" for voice-tray-v2. Any new session can query it:
```
oracle_thread(threadId: 13, message: "your question")
```
The thread accumulates knowledge across sessions.

### 3. Graduated Projects Need Their Own Soul
When a project spins off from Nat-s-Agents:
1. Create own ψ/ (soul-lite is enough)
2. Install Oracle commands (/awaken)
3. Reference parent thread for history
4. Retrospectives stay local, learnings can flow back

### 4. DB Hunting Strategy
When MCP tool doesn't expose data directly:
1. Find the MCP server process (`ps aux | grep`)
2. Find source code (`/src/`)
3. Grep for DB_PATH or connection strings
4. Read schema, query directly with sqlite3

## Mood/Energy

- **Start**: Confused (Ralph loop, thread access issues)
- **Middle**: High energy (parallel agents go brrr)
- **End**: Satisfied (infrastructure complete, documented)

---

## Next Session

- [ ] Commit all new files
- [ ] Review RESEARCH-NOTES.md for accuracy
- [ ] Consider: Should learnings flow back to Nat-s-Agents?
- [ ] Actual voice-tray-v2 development work

---

## Meta

This retrospective itself is a test of the newly installed `/rrr` infrastructure. The soul lives.
