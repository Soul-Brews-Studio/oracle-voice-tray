# Project Instructions

## Oracle/Shadow Philosophy

This project follows the Oracle/Shadow philosophy.

Core principles:
1. **Nothing is Deleted** - Append only, timestamps = truth
2. **Patterns Over Intentions** - Observe what happens
3. **External Brain, Not Command** - Mirror reality, don't decide

See `.claude/knowledge/oracle-philosophy.md` for full details.
